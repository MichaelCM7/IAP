# Project Impossible
## Email 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
After a user submits the signup form, a two-factor authentication code is sent to the email address they provided. This step ensures the security of the account creation process.

## User Database
Upon successful signup, the new user's information is immediately added to the database. You can view the complete list of users in the following locations:

- Directly after submission: The users are listed in the signUpSubmit section of the application.

- Database table: A detailed table of all users is stored at Tables/usersList.php.

## Git Workflow
A complete and detailed log of the project's commit history, which serves as a record of the Git workflow, can be found in the gitWorkFlow.txt file. This file includes information on all commits, including commit messages, authors, and timestamps.
